# The ServiceMonitor is configured with secure TLS by default using cert-manager certificates.
# The monitor.yaml file references the metrics-server-cert secret created by cert-manager.
# Ensure that cert-manager resources are enabled in config/default/kustomization.yaml
# and that the [METRICS WITH CERTMANAGER] patch is applied to mount the certificate in the Manager Deployment.
#
# For development/testing without cert-manager, you can use this patch to override with insecure configuration:
#patches:
#  - path: monitor_tls_patch.yaml
#    target:
#      kind: ServiceMonitor
