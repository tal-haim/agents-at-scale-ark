# Streaming

> Note: This is a work-in-progress specification for an upcoming feature. This document will change as the implementation evoles and is tested. Streaming is currently implemented as additional endpoints within a Memory resource. In future releases, a dedicated EventStream resource will be introduced. A single service can optionally implement both Memory and streaming APIs.

Real-time message streaming allows users to see agent responses as they're generated during query execution.

Streaming is implemented in line with the [OpenAI Streaming Responses](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/streaming-responses) specification, meaning that any client that supports the OpenAI spec can read streaming responses from Ark queries. The OpenAI `v1/completions` [Ark Api](/reference/ark-apis) streams responses when the `stream=True` parameter is set.

## Enabling Streaming

Enable streaming for a query by setting the `ark.mckinsey.com/streaming-enabled` annotation:

```yaml
apiVersion: ark.mckinsey.com/v1alpha1
kind: Query
metadata:
  name: my-query
  annotations:
    # Enable streaming for this query.
    ark.mckinsey.com/streaming-enabled: "true"
spec:
  input: "Hello"
  # Point to a memory resource that implemnts the event stream API.
  memory: "streaming-memory"
  targets:
    - name: my-agent
```

The Ark OpenAI completions API returns a streaming response when `stream: true` is set:

```bash
# Curl the ark api completions endpoint with streaming enabled.
curl -N -X POST http://ark-api.default.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080/openai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "model/gpt-4",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Write a haiku about streaming data"}
    ],
    "stream": true  # <-- Enable streaming
  }'
```

The response will be Server-Sent Events (SSE) with streaming chunks in OpenAI format, following the [Read Stream](#read-stream) API specification, which is fully OpenAI compatible. This means that consumers can query Ark and stream responses as if it was an LLM, and use existing OpenAI SDKs etc.

## Streaming Responses

Standard OpenAI streaming response chunks are sent for each query target type. An additional [Ark Metadata](#the-ark-metadata-field) field is attached to each chunk to provide additional details such as the session ID and query target, which allows for complex streaming responses from multi-target or team queries to be processed client-side.

Streaming responses follow the OpenAI specification exactly; the additional `ark` field will not interfere with regular clients as the OpenAI spec allows for additional fields to be included in the response (which standard clients will ingore).

If an LLM does not support streaming, the complete response from the model will be sent at the end of the query as a single chunk, as per the OpenAI specification. Streamign is currently supported in Ark for `openai` and `azure` models and is not yet supported for `bedrock` models.

### Model Query Streaming

Direct model queries stream the LLM response, exactly as per the OpenAI Completions API specification:

```bash
curl -N "http://localhost:8083/stream/model-query-123"
```

```
data: {"choices":[{"delta":{"content":"The"}}],"ark":{"model":"gpt-4","query":"123","target":"model/gpt-4"}}
data: {"choices":[{"delta":{"content":" capital"}}],"ark":{"model":"gpt-4","query":"123","target":"model/gpt-4"}}
data: {"choices":[{"delta":{"content":" is"}}],"ark":{"model":"gpt-4","query":"123","target":"model/gpt-4"}}
```

### Agent Query Streaming  

Agent queries include intermediate tool calls in the stream. This allows you to show tool calls as they happen in team time:

```bash
curl -N "http://localhost:8083/stream/agent-query-456"
```

```
data: {"choices":[{"delta":{"tool_calls":[{"function":{"name":"web_search","arguments":"{\"query\":\"weather\"}"}}]}}],"ark":{"agent":"researcher","model":"gpt-4","query":"456"}}
data: {"choices":[{"delta":{"content":"Based"}}],"ark":{"agent":"researcher","model":"gpt-4","query":"456"}}
data: {"choices":[{"delta":{"content":" on"}}],"ark":{"agent":"researcher","model":"gpt-4","query":"456"}}
```

Tool call chunks are sent exactly as per the OpenAI specification.

### Team Query Streaming

Team queries stream all LLM calls from every team member, providing full visibility into multi-agent execution responses and tool calls:

```bash
curl -N "http://localhost:8083/stream/team-query-789"
```

```
data: {"choices":[{"delta":{"content":"Let"}}],"ark":{"agent":"team-leader","team":"research-team","model":"gpt-4","query":"789","target":"team/research-team"}}
data: {"choices":[{"delta":{"content":" me"}}],"ark":{"agent":"team-leader","team":"research-team","model":"gpt-4","query":"789"}}
data: {"choices":[{"delta":{"content":"I'll"}}],"ark":{"agent":"analyst","team":"research-team","model":"gpt-4","query":"789"}}
```

If using the OpenAI completions API to query teams with streaming, it becomes the client's responsiblilty to decide how to render the chunks. With a regular, non-streaming call, Ark will do exactly as OpenAI does and return only the final response from the team (without any speification on what the agent was). However, for a real-time streaming response it is not possible to 'filter' this down to only the final response (as team members can execute in parallel and the final message cannot be determined in advance deterministically).

This means that OpenAI compability is not possible when querying teams with streaming - the client must check the `ark` metadata fields to see what agent is currently responding.

## The Ark Metadata Field

The `ark` metadata field identifies which agent is currently contributing, as well as other parameters for the query. This is essential when trying to process responses from targets such as teams, which will contain stream chunks for multiple agents and tools.

All chunks include `ark` metadata:

```json
{
  "ark": {
    "query": "789",                  // Query ID
    "session": "sess-123",           // Session ID if applicable
    "target": "team/research-team",  // Query target (team/agent/model)
    "team": "research-team",         // Team name (for team queries)
    "agent": "analyst",              // Current agent name
    "model": "gpt-4"                 // Model being used
  }
}
```

The final chunk also includes the complete query object:

```json
{
  "ark": {
    "query": "789",
    "completedQuery": {              // Complete Query object (final chunk only)
      "metadata": {
        "name": "my-query",
        "annotations": {
          "ark.mckinsey.com/a2a-context-id": "ctx-abc123"
        }
      },
      "spec": {
        "input": "...",
        "sessionId": "sess-123"
      },
      "status": {
        "phase": "done",
        "tokenUsage": {...},
        "a2a": {                     // A2A protocol metadata
          "contextId": "ctx-abc123",
          "taskId": "task-xyz789"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `completedQuery` field contains the complete [Query object](/reference/resources/query) including metadata, spec, and status. This provides access to annotations, labels, token usage, and A2A metadata. This field is only present in the final chunk.

Clients aware of this field can display rich multi-agent interactions and tool calls. The `ark` CLI demonstrates this with the `chat` function, which shows team member responses and intermediate tool calls.

## Event Streaming Architecture

Writing Stream (Query Execution):
```
┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────────┐
│ Client   │───→│ ARK API  │───→│ Query Controller │───→│ Event Streaming      │
│(request) │    └──────────┘    └──────────────────┘    │ Service              │
└──────────┘    (Create Query)   (Stream chunks)        └──────────────────────┘
                                  POST /stream/{id}
```

Reading Stream (Client Consumption):
```
┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────────────────┐
│ Client   │───→│ ARK API  │───→│ Event Streaming      │
│(response)│←───└──────────┘←───│ Service              │
└──────────┘    GET ../stream   └──────────────────────┘
               (SSE chunks)      GET /stream/{id}
```

When streaming is enabled:

1. Client creates a Query resource through the Kubernetes API
2. Query Controller writes OpenAI-compatible chunks using the [Write Stream](#write-stream) API as they're generated from LLMs
3. Consumers connect and read events in real-time using the [Read Stream](#read-stream) API
4. Query Controller calls the [Complete Stream](#complete-stream) API when the entire query execution finishes (which may involve multiple LLM completions across agents and teams)

All OpenAI-compatible chunks are passed through as-is, including text content, tool calls, and finish reasons. When queries involve teams or multiple agents, intermediate `finish_reason` chunks are forwarded but do not close the stream - only the explicit completion signal from the Query Controller ends the stream with `data: [DONE]`.

If a query target does not support streaming (as is currently the case for some models), then as-per the OpenAI specification the streaming APIs will return the entire response in a single chunk at the end of query execution.

### Event Streaming Service

An Event Streaming Service is any service that implements the [Event Stream API](#event-stream-api). To configure event streaming, deploy a ConfigMap that specifies the service that should be used:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: ark-config-streaming
  namespace: default
data:
  enabled: "true"
  serviceRef: |
    name: ark-broker  # Service that implements the Event Stream API
    port: "http"              # Port name from the service definition
    namespace: ""             # Optional: namespace (defaults to current namespace)
```

When this ConfigMap is present and `enabled` is set to `"true"`, the Query Controller will use the specified service for event streaming. If the ConfigMap is not present or `enabled` is `"false"`, streaming is disabled. If a query is issued with the `streaming-enabled` annotation set to `true` and no event streaming service is available, a warning will be logged.

The `ark-broker` service implements this API when deployed with streaming enabled. 

### Tool/Function Calling in Streams

OpenAI's Chat Completions API supports streaming tool calls. Unlike text content which appears in `delta.content`, tool calls appear in `delta.tool_calls` and must be accumulated by index.

Tool call delta structure:
- `index`: Identifies which function call the delta is for
- `id`: Tool call ID (only in first delta)
- `function.name`: Function name (only in first delta)
- `function.arguments`: Argument fragments to accumulate
- `type`: Always "function" (only in first delta)

Example chunks showing `delta.tool_calls`:
```json
[{"index": 0, "id": "call_abc", "function": {"arguments": "", "name": "get_weather"}, "type": "function"}]
[{"index": 0, "function": {"arguments": "{\"location\":"}}]
[{"index": 0, "function": {"arguments": "\"Paris, France\"}"}}]
```

Clients must concatenate `function.arguments` across all deltas with the same index to reconstruct complete tool calls.

## Event Stream API

The event stream API can be used to read and write message chunks.

### Read Stream

`/stream/{query_id}`

Establishes SSE connection for receiving real-time messages. On disconnect, reconnect with `from-beginning=true` to replay stored chunks.

**Query Parameters:**

- `from-beginning=true` - Send all existing messages first, then stream new ones
- `wait-for-query=<timeout>` - Wait for query execution to start (e.g., `wait-for-query=30s`)

**Response Format:**

OpenAI-compatible streaming chunks sent as SSE events:

```
data: {"id":"chatcmpl-123","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1704067200,"model":"gpt-4","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":"Hello"},"finish_reason":null}]}
data: {"id":"chatcmpl-123","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1704067200,"model":"gpt-4","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":" world"},"finish_reason":null}]}
data: {"id":"chatcmpl-123","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1704067200,"model":"gpt-4","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{},"finish_reason":"stop"}]}
data: [DONE]
```

**Completion Signal:**

When streaming completes, the service sends:
1. A chunk with `finish_reason: "stop"`
2. Followed by `data: [DONE]`

### Write Stream

`/stream/{query_id}`

Write chunks to a stream. Controller disconnects (ECONNRESET) indicate timeout or network issues.

**Content-Type:** `application/x-ndjson`

**Request Body:**

Newline-delimited JSON chunks in OpenAI format:

```json
{"id":"chatcmpl-123","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1704067200,"model":"gpt-4","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":"Hello"},"finish_reason":null}]}
{"id":"chatcmpl-123","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1704067200,"model":"gpt-4","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":" world"},"finish_reason":null}]}
{"id":"chatcmpl-123","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1704067200,"model":"gpt-4","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{},"finish_reason":"stop"}]}
```

### Complete Stream

`/stream/{query_id}/complete`

Marks query execution as complete. Closes connections to consumers.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "completed", 
  "query": "my-query-id"
}
```

ARK's controller orchestrates execution across multiple agents/models and must explicitly signal completion to the memory service.
