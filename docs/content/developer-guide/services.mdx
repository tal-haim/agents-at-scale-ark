# Services

ARK provides a rich ecosystem of services that extend the platform's capabilities. These services are modular, Kubernetes-native components that can be installed and configured as needed.

## Installing Services

Use `make services` to install and configure additional service capabilities. The command will scan for services with manifest files and let you choose to install, run in dev mode, or uninstall each service.

```bash
make services
```

## Service Manifest Format

Each service must include a `manifest.yaml` file that describes the service and its capabilities:

```yaml
name: ark-broker
description: In-memory storage with streaming support
supports:
  - dev
  - install
  - uninstall
post-install-instructions: |
  Service is now running at: http://ark-broker:8080
```

The `post-install-instructions` field is optional and will be displayed after successful installation.

## Service Commands

Services follow a standard idiom using Make targets:

- `make <service-name>-dev` - Run the service in development mode locally
- `make <service-name>-install` - Build the container, push to cluster registry, and deploy using Helm
- `make <service-name>-uninstall` - Remove the service deployment from the cluster

The `install` command uses the `scripts/build-and-push.sh` helper to build and push container images to the cluster registry, then deploys the service using Helm charts.

## Exposing Services

Services are exposed through Kubernetes Gateway API using HTTPRoute resources. The ARK quickstart sets up a gateway that services can use for external access.

Individual services can also be exposed using `kubectl port-forward` (as shown in post-install instructions).

## Available Services

### Specialized Services
- **Evaluator LLM** - AI-powered query evaluation service using LLM-as-a-Judge
- **Evaluation Operator** - Automated evaluation and scoring of agent responses  

## Service Discovery and Annotations

ARK services use a standardized annotation system for discovery and integration:

### Service Annotations

Helm Charts can be annotated to provide metadata for discovery:

```yaml
# Chart.yaml
annotations:
  ark.mckinsey.com/service: "my-service"
  ark.mckinsey.com/resources: "service,deployment"
```

### Annotation Schema

| Annotation | Description | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| `ark.mckinsey.com/service` | Service identifier for ARK discovery | `langfuse` |
| `ark.mckinsey.com/resources` | Resource types created by chart | `service,a2aserver` |
