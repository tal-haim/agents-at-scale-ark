# Penetration Testing Reports

ARK undergoes regular security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the platform. Note that as per our [Disclaimer](../../disclaimer.mdx), security is the responsibility of the operator and user. However, we regularly run assessments to ensure that we enable standard K8S security approaches.

If there are questions on these topics please open an issue and we aim to reply in short-notice.

## Report Overview

Penetration testing reports provide detailed analysis of security findings, recommended mitigations, and implementation status for identified vulnerabilities.

### Pentest #1

- **Assessment Period:** July - August 2025
- **Remediation Status:** August 19, 2025 
- **Overall Risk Level:** Medium-Low, remediated to Low

| Risk Level | Count | Status |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Critical | 0 | - |
| High | 0 | - |
| Medium | 1 | Remediated to Low |
| Low | 3 | Mixed |
| Informational | 2 | Open |

##### M1. Overly Permissive RBAC Roles

Service accounts had excessive cluster-wide permissions.

**Resolution - Partly Remediated**

Cluster roles replaced with namespace-specific roles.

Some elevated permissions remain for the Ark MCP service and Ark API service to allow them to directly access the Kubernetes APIs to modify resources such as `Agents`.

Additional security improvements in progress.

##### L1. Missing Network Policies

No network segmentation between components

**Resolution - Partly Remediated**

Policies implemented for ark-system namespace. Default namespace will be a cluster administrator responsibility, operational guides are being updated and additional testing is ongoing.

##### L2. Container Security Hardening

Missing security configurations across services.

**Resolution - In Progress**

Privilege escalation prevention, non-root users, read-only filesystems.

##### L3. No Authentication Documentation for Dashboard

Dashboard and API services lack authentication documentation.

**Status - Accepted Risk** - Mitigated by local-only deployment design. However, optional OIDC integration is in progress.

##### IN1. Unencrypted HTTP

Services use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

**Status - Accepted Risk**

Low impact due to local deployment model. However, service mesh with cert-manager will be updated so that all traffic even in local development mode will be via SSL.

##### IN2. Missing Security Headers

Dashboard lacks protective HTTP headers.

**Status - Remediated** (see Pentest #2 L3)

### Pentest #2

- **Assessment Period:** December 2025
- **Assessor:** DataArt
- **Remediation Status:** January 2026
- **Overall Risk Level:** Medium-Low, remediated to Low

| Risk Level | Count | Status |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Critical | 0 | - |
| High | 0 | - |
| Medium | 1 | Remediated |
| Low | 5 | Remediated |

##### M1. Clickjacking Protection

Dashboard and API lacked X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy frame-ancestors headers.

**Resolution - Remediated**

Added security headers to all Ingress configurations including X-Frame-Options: DENY and Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'.

##### L1. Overly Permissive RBAC Roles

The ark-deployer ClusterRole had cluster-wide delete permissions.

**Resolution - Remediated**

Removed delete permissions from ark-deployer. Deployment automation limited to create, update, and patch operations.

##### L2. Container Security Hardening

Services missing comprehensive security contexts.

**Resolution - Remediated**

Added pod and container security contexts: runAsNonRoot, runAsUser, fsGroup, seccompProfile, privilege escalation prevention, and capability dropping.

##### L3. Missing Security Headers

Ingress configurations lacked protective HTTP headers.

**Resolution - Remediated**

Added X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Strict-Transport-Security, and Referrer-Policy headers to all Ingress configurations.

##### L4. TLS Version Control

Gateway accepted outdated TLS versions.

**Resolution - Remediated**

Configured Gateway resources to enforce TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 only.

##### L5. Weak Cipher Suites

Gateway accepted weak cipher suites.

**Resolution - Remediated**

Configured strong cipher suites with forward secrecy (ECDHE-based ciphers).
