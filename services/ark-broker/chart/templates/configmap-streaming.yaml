# ConfigMap that enables real-time streaming of AI model responses through ark-broker.
# When present, the ARK controller and SDK clients will stream chunks directly to connected
# clients instead of waiting for the full response. The service reference points to the
# streaming endpoint that handles Server-Sent Events (SSE) for OpenAI-compatible streaming.
